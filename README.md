# IRCC-CRS-points-prediction
I became a permanent resident of Canada this year. In the past, I noticed that many people—including myself—constantly checked the IRCC invitation website to monitor the cutoff scores. We wanted to understand how far we were from the required score and what steps we could take to improve our chances.
Inspired by this experience, I am starting to build a program that analyzes historical IRCC invitation data and predicts future cutoff scores across different immigration categories.

# IRCC CRS Dashboard

An **interactive dashboard** that visualizes Canada Express Entry Invitation trends over time, by category (e.g., CEC, PNP, FSW). Built using **Python**, **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas**.
